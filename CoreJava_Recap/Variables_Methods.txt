byte , short , int , long , float , double  ----> 0 or 0.0

char  -->  single space    
boolean ----> false

Types of Variables:
===================
1.Local Variable
2. Instance variable 
3. Static variable


Local variable:
--------------

A varible declare inside block (method,try,catch,loops,if-else,static) or
variables declare as parameters 

-> Local variable also known as Thread - Level variables or Temp variable
-> Loval variables values should be initialize by user , JVM can't initialise values to the local vars.


example1:

class  Demo {

	public static void main(String[] ar) {
	
		String name;

		System.out.println("Hello friends");
		
	}
	
	
	int  add(int a, int b) {
		
		int result;
		
		result = a+b;
		
		return result;
		
	}
}	




ex2:

try{

int x;  // local var


}
catch(Exception e){ // local var


}




Instance Variable:
------------------
Varibale declare inside class but outside all the blocks without static keyword is known as Instance variable.
-> Memory allocated in Heap Memory Block.
-> Instance vars also known as Object level variables.
-> Instance vars are used as  Data members or Properties in classes.
-> Once object is destroyed , all its mapping instance variables will be deleted.
-> In java every object will have seperate copy of Instance variables.
-> Instance  variables are used when we want to have seperate copy of properties for each entity/object
-> Instance Lifetime is same as lifetime of objects


Static variable:
---------------
-> Static variable , are declare inside the class outside all blocks using static keyword
-> Memory allocation for static members (vars,methods,blocks) will be  done during class loading
