OOPs:
-----
Object Oriented Programming Concepts are used in Programming where we focus more on Objects/Instances to represent real world entities rather than functionality / Behaviour.

c-lang:

String   employee_details(){

	  return "101 king  salary";


}

-------------
OOPs lang:  Java , c++ , c#

class  Employee{


public Employee	getEmployeeDetails(){

	Employee e1 = new Employee(101,"king",50000);

	Address  a1 = new Address();

	BankAccount  account = new BankAccount();

	return e1;

	}

}










OOPs:
------
1.Object and Class
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Abstraction
6. Data Hiding
7. Cohesion and Coupling



Object:
-------
Object is a real world entity which exist physically.
Object is an instance of a class.
Object can have state and behaviour
Object are created by using new Operator by JVM in Heap memory.

  String  s1 =   new  String();



Class:
------
Class is a collection of objects.
Class is a blue print using it one can create instances/objects.
Class is  imaginary in nature.
Class is a reusable component.


class   Employee{


	int eid;
	String ename;
	double salary;



}




class Object{



  int	hashcode(){}
	
   String toString(){  

	return  pkgname.classname@+hashcode();

 	
 }

 boolean  equals();
  	
  void finalize();

  Class	getClass();
	
	clone();

	wait();
	notify();
	notifyAll();


	



}
