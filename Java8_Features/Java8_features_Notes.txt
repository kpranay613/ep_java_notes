Java8 Features:
---------------
1. Functional Interface
2. Lambda expression
3. static , default methods
4. java.time package
5. Stream API
6. method and constructor references (::)


Functional Interface:
An interface which will have only one abstract method.


Lambda Expression:

It is an implementation of Functional Interface.
It is anonymous block with parameters and body.

syn:
 
   (int x, int y){  // anonymous block

	return x+y;
	
  } 









Types of Functional Interface/Lambda Expression:
================================================
1. Function Functional Interface

If Interface abstract method takes some parameters and returns some value known as Function Functional interface and its implementation is known as Function Lambda Expression.

	int  find(int x)
	int add(int a , int b);
	int findLength(String str);


2. Consumer Functional Interface
If Functional interface's abstract method  accept some inputs but does not return any value then its known as Consumer Functional interface and its implementation known Consumer Lambda Expression.

	void  setName(String name);
	void  print(int x, double d);


3. Supplier Functional Interface
If Functional interface's abstract method  does not accept inputs but  it always return some value then its known as Supplier Functional interface and its implementation known Supplier Lambda Expression.

	String  getName();
	int     result();
	boolean   isValid();


4. Predicate Functional Interface
If Interface abstract method takes some parameters and returns always boolean value known as Predicate Functional interface and its implementation is known as Predicate Lambda Expression.

	boolean add(int a , int b);
	boolean findLength(String str);


-----------------------------------------------------

Note: Till Java7 interfaces cannot have methods with body

But , from Java8 interfaces can also have non-abstract methods/method with body.


public interface MyInterface{

	//abstract methods
  // non-abstract methods  should be define as static or default


}

static method: 
static method can be called by using interface name.
Note: Anybody can call static methods irrespective of that interface is implemented by that person or not.

default method:
default method can be called only by using Interface implementation (class/lambda exp) object.

It can be used only by those people who implements given interface either using class in Java7 or
using lambda exp in java8.
