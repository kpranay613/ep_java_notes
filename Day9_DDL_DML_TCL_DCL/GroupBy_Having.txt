Group By:
---------
It is used to group records based on specific set of  values.
Group By clause consider Null value also as one of the group.

mysql> select   SUM(salary) from Employee Group By Job;
+-------------+
| SUM(salary) |
+-------------+
|    50000.00 |
|    85000.00 |
|    65000.00 |
|    47000.00 |
|    47000.00 |
|        NULL |
+-------------+


mysql> select  Job,  SUM(salary) from Employee Group By Job;
+-----------+-------------+
| Job       | SUM(salary) |
+-----------+-------------+
| President |    50000.00 |
| Manager   |    85000.00 |
| Developer |    65000.00 |
| Tester    |    47000.00 |
| Analyst   |    47000.00 |
| NULL      |        NULL |
+-----------+-------------+

mysql> select  EName,  SUM(salary) from Employee Group By Job;  

// above query throw error because Ename should be there in Group By clause.

Note: What ever column used in projection/select should be there in Group By clause. 
    What ever column used in Group By need not to be there in Select/projection.



Steps for Where ---> Group by ---> Having ---> Order by

Step1  where:

mysql> select  Job,  salary from Employee where  Job IN ('Developer','Tester','Manager');
+-----------+----------+
| Job       | salary   |
+-----------+----------+
| Manager   | 45000.00 |
| Manager   | 40000.00 |
| Developer | 30000.00 |
| Developer | 35000.00 |
| Tester    | 25000.00 |
| Tester    | 22000.00 |
+-----------+----------+


Step2   Group By

mysql> select  Job , Sum(salary) from Employee where  Job IN ('Developer','Tester','Manager') Group by Job;
+-----------+-------------+
| Job       | Sum(salary) |
+-----------+-------------+
| Manager   |    85000.00 |
| Developer |    65000.00 |
| Tester    |    47000.00 |
+-----------+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)


Step3  Having clause

mysql> select  Job , Sum(salary) from Employee where  Job IN ('Developer','Tester','Manager') Group by Job
    ->  Having  Sum(salary) > 50000;
+-----------+-------------+
| Job       | Sum(salary) |
+-----------+-------------+
| Manager   |    85000.00 |
| Developer |    65000.00 |
+-----------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Step4  Order By

mysql> select  Job , Sum(salary) from Employee where  Job IN ('Developer','Tester','Manager') Group by Job
    ->  Having  Sum(salary) > 50000 Order By Job;
+-----------+-------------+
| Job       | Sum(salary) |
+-----------+-------------+
| Developer |    65000.00 |
| Manager   |    85000.00 |
+-----------+-------------+


mysql> select Job,Mid , Count(*)  from  Employee  Where Job != 'Manager'  Group By Job ,Mid  Having  Count(*) > 1;
+-----------+------+----------+
| Job       | Mid  | Count(*) |
+-----------+------+----------+
| Developer |  102 |        2 |
| Tester    |  103 |        2 |
+-----------+------+----------+


mysql> select Job,  Count(*)  from  Employee  Group By Job;
+-----------+----------+
| Job       | Count(*) |
+-----------+----------+
| President |        1 |
| Manager   |        2 |
| Developer |        2 |
| Tester    |        2 |
| Analyst   |        1 |
| NULL      |        1 |
+-----------+----------+

Having without Group By can be used:


mysql> select  sum(salary)  from employee  having sum(salary) > 50000;
+-------------+
| sum(salary) |
+-------------+
|   294000.00 |
+-------------+
