DML:
Data Manipulation Lang:

INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE 

These commands are used to manage/manipulate records or data in tables.

INSERT Command:
It is used to create or insert new records in tables.

syn1:   INSERT INTO Table_Name values(v1,v2,v3,...);
syn2:   INSERT INTO Table_Name(c1,c2,c3)   values(v1,v2,v3);//remaining column values will taken as null
syn3:  INSERT INTO Table_Name(v1,v2,v3,..)  , (v11,v12,v13,...) , (v21,v22,v23,...); // multiple records

Examples:

INSERT INTO Products values(1,'mobile',15000,current_date,'IPhone');

INSERT INTO Products values(2,'laptop',25000,current_date,'Dell') , (3,'Books',1200,current_date,'BlackBook') , (4,'Toys',1500,current_date,'KidsZee');

INSERT INTO Products(pid,product_name) values(5,'Keyboard');





UPDATE:
--------
Update command is used to modify existing data in tables.

syn:  update table_name set column1= value1 , column2 = value2 Where condition ;

Note: IN mysql software DB all DML commands are auto-commit means system controls all transactions

Ex:  update products  set price = 3000 , brand = 'Dell' where  pid = 5;

update products set price = 100; // this query updates all prices = 100 in products table;

rollback;  // it is useless , it wont rollback any thing 



DELETE:
-------
Delete command is used to delete records from the tables.


syn: delete table_name where condition;

Ex1: delete from products; // it will delete all the records from products table and cannot be rollback
Ex2: delete from products where pid = 5;// only record pid = 5 deleted

rollback;


begin transaction;

insert;
update;
delete;

commit/rollback;



TCL:
Transaction control Lang:
COMMIT , ROLLBACK , SAVEPOINT

These commands are used to control transactions by user/developer.

Note: In mysql software DML is auto-commit by default because system controls transactions by default.

In mysql if we want to control transactions then  need to start transaction manually and end transaction either using commit/rollback.
Ex:

start transaction;

INSERT;
UPDATE;
DELETE;

commit; // tosave permanently
rollback; // to perform undo



savepoint:
----------
it is used just like a book mark during DML Operations.

start transaction;

insert;
insert;
insert;
insert;

savepoint s1;


update;
update;

savepoint s2;

insert;
insert;

savepoint s3;

rollback s2;

commit s1;
