Sub Queries:

Writing query inside another query is known as sub-query/nested query.

In this , always sub-query executed first and output of sub query will be used as input by outer / parent query.


syn: select  columns  from  Table1  where  id = ( select id from Table2 );

mysql> select * from Employee where  salary > (select salary from Employee where ename = 'Tom');

SubQueries can be used for same table or for diff tables.
Ex: When we want to fetch data from one table but conditions available in second table then sub query can be used.

mysql> select * from employee  where salary >ANY  
				(select   COMM  from  Employee  where Job = 'Developer');


mysql> select * from Employee where salary >ANY (select  sum(salary)  from Employee where Job = 'Tester');


mysql> SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE  DNO = (SELECT DNO FROM DEPT WHERE LOCATION = 'Chennai');

mysql>  (SELECT DNO FROM DEPT WHERE LOCATION = 'Chennai');

1 row in set (0.00 sec)

step2
mysql> SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE  DNO = 40;

Multi-Levels in Sub queries:
----------------------------
mysql> SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE  DNO =                                                                                                     (SELECT DNO FROM DEPT WHERE LOCATION =                                                                               (SELECT LOCATION FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME = 'RESEARCH'));
